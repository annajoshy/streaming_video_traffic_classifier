## Robust Streaming Video Traffic Classification
### Jordan Ebel

This project contains implementations of ML classifiers for identifying
encrypted streaming video traffic.  The matlab directory contains 
experimental MatLab scripts written during development, and the preprocess
directory contains Python scripts for feature extraction and a real-time
streaming video traffic classifier.

See paper.pdf for a written report on the project.
